1. Loading and Preprocessing
  Briefly explain the Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features, and 3 species).
  Mention that the species column is dropped since clustering is unsupervised.

2A. KMeans Clustering
Algorithm Explanation:
  Define KMeans clustering and its iterative steps (assigning points and updating centroids).
  State that KMeans minimizes within-cluster variance.
Why Suitable for Iris Dataset:
  Explain that the Iris dataset has clear separable groups, making it a good candidate for KMeans.
Result Observations:
  Briefly interpret the clustering results by analyzing the plots (mention overlapping clusters if any).

2B. Hierarchical Clustering
Algorithm Explanation:
  Explain the hierarchical process, including linkage methods (mention Wardâ€™s method in your implementation).
  Differentiate agglomerative and divisive clustering.
Why Suitable for Iris Dataset:
  Mention the structured nature of Iris data, where hierarchical clustering can help visualize relationships between clusters.
Result Observations:  
  Analyze dendrogram results (cut-off point explanation if shown in the dendrogram) and pair plot interpretations.
